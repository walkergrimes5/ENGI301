ENGI 301 Project 1 - Drone Motor Proof of Concept

To run this project, you must connect all the drone motors to the control breakout board. Make sure the white wire of the drone harness is on the PWM side (colored wires) of the board. The board must be in turn connected to all of the PWM pins on the pocket beagle (P1_33,P1_36, P2_1, P2_3) and to ground. Any ground pin on the PocketBeagle will work. Once these connections are made, connect the power distribution board to power, to turn on the ESC units. Either a battery with an XT60 connector or alligator clips from a power supply will work. The motors will beep when they turn on. Finally, to start the code and run the motors, apply power to the pocket beagle. On startup the Pocket Beagle will run the code. Details on the connection can be found on the fritzing diagram on the Hackster page linked below.
